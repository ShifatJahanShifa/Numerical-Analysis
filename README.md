# numerical-analysis
I will upload here all of my codes regarding Numerical Analysis course (MATH-304). All codes are written in c language.

list of topics: 
1) matrix multiplication.
2) transpose of a matrix and multiplication of that matrix with given matrix
3) implementation of gauss elimination process
4) implementation of gauss-jordan method 
5) finding quadratic polynomial that is least square fit to a given data using Gauss Elimination process.
6) bisection method
7) false position method
8) newton raphson method
9) secant method
10) fixed point iteration method
11) numerical differentiation
12) integration with trapezoidal rule
13) jacobi iteration
14) gauss-seidal method
15) power iteration
16) jacobian rotations & svd -> Assignment -02.c 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

usage: 
1) just download and run.
OS: windows, linux
* caution: if any code includes input file, make sure you have input file in the location where the code file exists or
           you can remove including input file or customize your own input file.
